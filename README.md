# 斗兽棋-AnimalChess


```
At the beginning of the game, the blue side and the red side turn the cards randomly, and the color of the turned cards determines the color of the chess pieces controlled by both sides.

Each player can only move a piece once per round.

The two sides have not swallowed for 20 consecutive steps and settled the situation.

In the end, if there is only one chess piece left, the winner with a large number of points will be equalized.
